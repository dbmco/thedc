# The Good News

## Step 1
God loves you and wants you to experience peace and
life - abundant and eternal.

### The Bible Says…
“We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
-Romans 5:1

“For God so loved the world that He gave his one and
only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but
have eternal life.”
-John 3:16

“I have come that they may have life, and that they may
have it more abundantly.” - Jesus
-John 10:10

## Step 2
God created us in His own image to have abundant life.
He did not make us as robots to automatically love and
obey Him. God gave us a will and freedom of choice.We
chose to disobey God and go our own willful way. We still
make this choice today, resulting in separation from God.

### The Bible Says…
“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”
 -Romans 3:23

“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal
life In Christ Jesus our Lord.”
-Romans 6:23

## Step 3
Jesus Christ died on the cross and then rose from the grave.
He paid the penalty for our sin to bridge the gap between God
and people.

### The Bible Says…
“For there is one God and one mediator between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus.”
-1 Timothy 2:5
“For Christ died for sins once and for all, the righteous for the
unrighteous, to bring you to God.”
-1 Peter 3:18
“But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: while we
were still sinners, Christ died for us.”
-Romans 5:8

## Step 4
We must trust Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and receive Him
by personal invitation.

### The Bible Says…
“Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His
name, He gave the right to become children of God.”
-John 1:12
“That if you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and
believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you
will be saved.”
-Romans 10:9

### Here is how you can receive Christ:
1. Admit your need (I am a sinner).
2. Be willing to turn from your sins (repent).
3. Believe that Jesus Christ died for you on the cross and rose from the grave.
4. Through prayer, invite Jesus Christ to come in and control your life through the Holy Spirit. (Receive Him as Lord and Savior). It’s just that simple.
“Repent and believe the Good News!”
-Mark 1:15

### A Suggested Prayer
“Lord Jesus Christ, I know I am a sinner and do not deserve
eternal life. But, I believe You died and rose from the grave to
purchase a place in heaven for me. Lord Jesus, come into my
life; take control of my life; forgive my sins and save me. I repent
of my sins and now place my trust in You for my salvation. I
accept Your free give of eternal life. Amen.”
If this prayer is the sincere desire of your heart, look at what
Jesus promises to those who believe in Him:

“Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has
everlasting life.”
John 6:47
“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and
this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works,
so that no one can boast.”
-Ephesians 2:8, 9

This is just the beginning of a wonderful new life in Christ.
To deepen this relationship you should:
1. Read your Bible every day to know Christ better.
2. Talk to God in prayer every day.
3. Tell others about Christ.
4. Worship, fellowship, and serve with other Christians in a church where Christ is preached.
5. As Christ’s representative in a needy world, demonstrate your new life by your love and concern for others.
