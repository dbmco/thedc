# Gates

### Attention Gatekeepers

#### Gatekeepers have three primary roles.

- To protect the Lord’s house.

This means they defend the gospel, the truth of the Word and Protect the holiness of God’s house. Their hearts are on fire with the Fear of the Lord. They want the Lord’s house to be a house of Prayer and they are not content until they see the Lord’s will come to place. The gatekeeper protects the House. They know the scriptures well and are full of understanding. They are bold to speak out against the sins of the church- even if it means they will be mocked, hated or even kicked out of the church. They stay close to the House of the Lord.

- They keep the Lord’s people on the right path.

Keeping them from drifting from the Lord. As a staff or sheepdog would keep the sheep together from straying, so the role of gatekeeper is the same. He is responsible to oversee the people, gently guide the drifter back and keep those on the threshold of evil paths from taking another step in the wrong direction. They are bold and not afraid to tell the truth of God;s word, knowing full well they are saving many from the fires of eternal hell.They are prayer warriors and intercessors for the people

- They keep watch for the master’s return; ready to usher in the King of Glory.

### Who are the gatekeepers

According to the Old Testament, a gatekeeper was a Levite. Gatekeepers where also watchmen on the walls. They were ministering priests from the tribe of Levi. Gatekeepers were trusted officials and high priests in the servant role of protecting the Lord’s house. They were stationed at all 4 gates (N,S, E, W). They also appointed and taught others around them to guard the gate as well. Their hearts were fully committed to the Lords will. Today’s gatekeepers hope and pray for revival and eagerly await the Lord’s return. They are always prepared and continually remind others to be ready. Gatekeepers made sure that nothing unholy entered into God’s house and nothing was allowed to leave unless it had approval. They were in charge of the Temple items and treasuries of the House of the Lord.

#### Gatekeepers gather the drifters and show them the right way

Gatekeepers role of protecting the people :  The gatekeepers of these last days have been commissioned to protect the sheep. You are to devote yourselves to holiness and to protect the sheep from drifting away.

   I saw a great crowd of people and no one was going the right way. Great crowds were everywhere. Not one person was facing the same way as another. Everyone was going and looking in different directions, scattering themselves. They weren’t concerned with where they were headed and kept walking in whatever direction they turned without any consideration. There was a lot of noise, and as I looked around I heard deep within my heart and all around me “Gatekeepers for the drifting”.

If you are reading this,  it may be your time to stand up and speak in the righteousness of the Lord - not for our own self-righteousness, but for the Honor of the Lord and for the salvation of those who are about to perish. We can no longer fear what man thinks, what he may say, do, or even notice their countenance – Fear God and what lies ahead for all of us. Take your stand and don’t turn to look around to the right or left, who cares what people think- ask yourself this “What does the Lord say?”.  Will he call you “Good and faithful servant” or an “evil coward”. Yikes, I know, that sounds harsh, but that’s what the scripture says. Don’t we all wish we could be make everyone happy with our words, but that is not our job. Our duty is to speak the truth in Love, snatching up those about to perish.

#### What is the significance of gatekeepers?

Gates are mentioned often in Scripture, and gatekeepers were an important part of maintaining order in ancient societies. Gatekeepers were guards stationed for protection at various kinds of gates, which could be city gates, palace gates, or temple gates. Ancient cities had high, thick walls around them to keep out wild beasts and invading armies (Joshua 7:5; Judges 5:8; Nehemiah 12:30). Heavy gates were set within those walls to allow entrance and exit. A gatekeeper had to be trustworthy and alert for any signs of trouble. A gatekeeper lax in his duties could bring ruin upon an entire civilization, so the idea of gatekeeping implies alertness and security. The keeper of the gates in Psalm 141:3 is none other than the Lord Himself, as He guards our mouths, preventing us from unwise speech.

David and Samuel appointed 212 gatekeepers for “positions of trust” in guarding the temple of the Lord (1 Chronicles 9:22), and those so appointed rotated through week-long assignments (verse 25). Verses 26–29 speak of the four principal gatekeepers, “who . . . were entrusted with the responsibility for the rooms and treasuries in the house of God. They would spend the night stationed around the house of God, because they had to guard it; and they had charge of the key for opening it each morning. Some of them were in charge of the articles used in the temple service; they counted them when they were brought in and when they were taken out. Others were assigned to take care of the furnishings and all the other articles of the sanctuary, as well as the special flour and wine, and the olive oil, incense and spices.” Temple gatekeepers were in charge of who went in and who went out. They ensured order and reverence for God’s house.

Ezra records that 139 gatekeepers made the trip from Babylon to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel (Ezra 2:42). When Nehemiah had finished the rebuilding of the wall around the city of Jerusalem, gatekeepers were some of the first positions he appointed (Nehemiah 7:1). This is significant because, before a city can conduct business, it must be protected from outside invaders. The Lord’s house required gatekeepers for the same reason. Before God’s business could be conducted properly, only the prescribed priests and other designated servants could be allowed through the gates. God had given clear commands about temple business (Exodus 25:8–9; cf. Hebrews 9:1–7). Gatekeepers were part of that holy business, and their positions were considered sacred (1 Chronicles 9:26; Nehemiah 12:47).

Our conscience, the fear of the Lord, and the Holy Spirit are “gatekeepers” for our hearts. “Through the fear of the LORD evil is avoided” (Proverbs 16:6). The Spirit desires our sanctification, giving us the power to repel sin. When temptation comes knocking at our gate, the Holy Spirit nudges our Scripture-informed conscience: “That’s dangerous. Don’t go there.” The divine Gatekeeper acts on our behalf to keep invaders from destroying us.

John Bunyan illustrates the need for a spiritual “gatekeeper” in his book The Holy War. In this allegory, Bunyan likens humanity to a city: “This famous town of Mansoul had five gates, in at which to come, out of which to go; and these were . . . impregnable, and such as could never be opened nor forced but by the will and leave of those within. The names of the gates were these: Ear-gate, Eye-gate, Mouth-gate, Nose-gate, and Feel-gate”. In other words, the five senses are the “gates” by which the human soul interacts with the world through the physical body. These gates must be guarded, and, in Bunyan’s allegory, Mr. Godly-Fear is just the man to do it. Godly-Fear was a trustworthy man of “courage, conduct, and valour,” and the enemy attacked Mansoul in vain, as long as Godly-Fear was the gatekeeper.

When we ignore our Gatekeeper, we put ourselves and those we love in jeopardy. But when we, in godly fear, heed the warnings of the Word and the Holy Spirit, we are safe. Our hearts and lives are protected from Satan’s invasive schemes (Ephesians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 2:11).

#### Summary of the John Bunyan's book The Holy War

In John Bunyan's allegorical work *The Holy War*, the concept of the five gates—Ear-gate, Eye-gate, Mouth-gate, Nose-gate, and Feel-gate—is central to understanding how the human soul interacts with the physical body. These gates symbolize the five senses and serve as entry points through which external influences can reach the soul, affecting a person's moral and spiritual state.

#### 1. **Ear-gate (Hearing)**
   - **Significance:** This gate represents the sense of hearing. It symbolizes how what we listen to can influence our thoughts, beliefs, and ultimately, our soul.
   - **Implication:** If one is not vigilant, harmful ideas, gossip, or corrupting influences can enter the soul through hearing, leading to spiritual and moral degradation.

#### 2. **Eye-gate (Seeing)**
   - **Significance:** This gate corresponds to the sense of sight. It represents how what we see can have a profound impact on our inner life.
   - **Implication:** By viewing inappropriate or morally corrupt images or actions, one’s soul can be tainted, leading to sin and spiritual weakness.

#### 3. **Mouth-gate (Speaking)**
   - **Significance:** This gate represents the sense of taste, but more broadly, it also relates to speech. The words we speak can reflect and shape our inner condition.
   - **Implication:** What we say can either build up or tear down both ourselves and others. If the Mouth-gate is not guarded, it can lead to harmful words that impact the soul negatively.

#### 4. **Nose-gate (Smelling)**
   - **Significance:** The Nose-gate represents the sense of smell. While it is less directly tied to moral and spiritual influence compared to the other senses, it still plays a role in how the soul interacts with the physical world.
   - **Implication:** The things we take in through smell can evoke memories or desires, influencing our emotional and spiritual state.

#### 5. **Feel-gate (Touching)**
   - **Significance:** This gate corresponds to the sense of touch. It represents physical interaction with the world and how it can influence the soul.
   - **Implication:** Improper or excessive physical indulgence can lead to moral compromise, illustrating the importance of controlling one's physical desires to protect the soul.

In Bunyan's allegory, these five gates are crucial because they symbolize how external influences (what we see, hear, speak, smell, and touch) enter our body and reach our soul. The soul, in Christian thought, is often seen as the seat of moral and spiritual life. Therefore, guarding these gates is necessary to maintain spiritual purity and moral integrity. The allegory emphasizes the need for vigilance and discipline in controlling the senses to protect one's soul from corrupting influences.
