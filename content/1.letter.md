### Walking in Continious Prayer

Tearing down strongholds begins with understanding the foundation of obedience and faithfulness. The saints proclaim, "Joy is worth attaining!" Those walking in boldness, with the strength of the Holy Spirit, understand this deeply.

Some dismiss the personal and sacred act of giving, presenting a false dilemma: salvation by faith is what we believe. Some avoid discussing obedience. The Saints proclaim, "There is Joy in Obedience." Some present a flawed approach which creates a forced duality thus producing a man-made hurdle for the new believer. Jesus came to abolish that. Under this false diachomity, the new beliver is then set upon a tighrope, but Jesus does not see our behavior the way we see our own behavior. Jesus accepts us anyway; He is rich father, and He desires to shower His childern with His blessings. Paul himself, who championed salvation by grace alone, also emphasized the importance of generosity and obedience in faith. Additionally, the fallacy of this forced duality leads to unnecessary conflict within the body, when in reality Jesus accepts all walks. Now, granted, Jesus was not a, "you do you babe," type of guy, but he did not come for the self-righteous, but for the lowly in heart, those humble towards God. Giving originates from obedience and faithfulness; Obedience compels our heart towards the shoreline. The saints proclaim, "abundant joy is achievable from obedience and faithfullness to God, and He is generous with those who come to Him without joy, who are low in heart, quietly doing His work.

### The Significance of Seven in the Bible

The number seven holds deep biblical significance—seven days of creation, seven feasts, seven “I Am” statements, and seven miraculous signs in the Gospel of John. Likewise, Paul wrote letters to seven churches: Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colossae, and Thessalonica. These churches, each with their unique struggles, serve as a lesson to believers today.

Paul’s earliest epistle was to the Galatians. In that region, he and Barnabas planted churches amid fierce opposition. In Lystra, Paul healed a man lame from birth, demonstrating the power of faith. Yet, radical unbelievers stirred up riots, stoning Paul and dragging his body outside the city, assuming he was dead. Miraculously, Paul got up and continued his mission, undeterred by persecution.

The Galatian church was plagued by false teachings claims that obedience to the Law was necessary for salvation. Paul’s letter to them was clear: “We know that a person is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ” (Galatians 2:16). Yet, while salvation is by grace alone, Paul also reminded believers of their call to faithfulness and obedience: “For freedom, Christ set us free. Stand firm, then, and don’t submit again to a yoke of slavery” (Galatians 5:1).

### Giving as an Act of Obedience

Giving is an act of obedience. When you give out of obedience you are demonstrating faith in terms how you give, that is, not letting your left hand know what your right hand is doing. In this we find rich rewards. 

False teachers avoid discussing obedience, this leaves new believers stranded, as the importance of obedience is left unrealized, but that's how strong His love is for His children. False teachers preach a new-age "what's in it for me" mindset, which lacks the humility rooted in obedience and faithfulness. Matthew teaches us to not let our left hand know what our right hand is doing. We must even exercise discernment within ourself; We must also walk in continious prayer. Just as Paul encouraged early churches to give, believers today must also recognize the sanctity of their first fruits. Giving is not merely about money; it encompasses time, resources, and service. Paul rebuked the Corinthian troublemakers for their showmanship giving. Likewise, in modern churches, some have turned tithes into a means of profiteering, while others distort giving into the false doctrine of karma. Furthermore, some have turned to giving into using their giving for virtue signaling.

The truth is that joy comes from obedience. It is a challenging path but one with immense rewards. The Holy Spirit leads us in our giving, and we must listen. However, Scripture teaches otherwise: “Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing” (Matthew 6:3). True giving is not performative; Giving in Secret is a sacred covenant between each of us individually, and the creator of the universe.

### The Lord’s Healing and Provision

Paul’s journey shows that walking with Jesus brings healing—physically, mentally, and spiritually. As cellular mitosis renews our bodies, so too does faith regenerate our souls. Christ heals and restores us, offering peace of mind and protection. But some flaunt their spiritual immunity, leaving behind those who struggle. Jesus’ message is for all, not some. At the same time, Jesus didn't just say, "You do you boo."

The early church understood this. They faced hardships, yet their faith grew. Today, as a congregation, we must prepare to receive those who are spiritually ill. Many healings will take place, and many will find joy in the light of Christ. As we approach a new season, we must ensure that our lamps remain trimmed and stocked, ready to shine brightly in a world that desperately needs His light. 

If you have not accepted Him, will you today? He is waiting at the door and knocks. Do not be like the five foolish virgins who were unprepared. Step into the joy of the Lord, and walk in the strength of His Spirit.

Amen.
