#### Preface

The biblical principle of **first fruits** relates to **quality olives for oil** and **being crushed to produce the best oil for our lamp** in a deeply symbolic and spiritual way.

##### **First Fruits and the Best Offering**
In the Bible, the concept of **first fruits** is about offering the **best and first portion** of a harvest to God as an act of faith, gratitude, and devotion (Exodus 23:19, Proverbs 3:9). Just as the Israelites were commanded to bring the **first and best of their crops**, including olives, this principle can be applied spiritually—offering our **best efforts, time, and devotion** to God.

##### **Olives and Oil in Biblical Symbolism**
Olives are frequently used as a metaphor for spiritual life in Scripture. To produce the finest olive oil—especially for **lamps in the temple (Exodus 27:20)**—olives had to be **crushed** through a careful process. This crushing represents:
1. **Purification** – Only the **purest oil** from the first pressing was used in the temple lamp, symbolizing a heart fully devoted to God.
2. **Suffering and Refinement** – Just as olives are crushed to release oil, believers often go through trials and hardships to bring out their **greatest spiritual potential** (2 Corinthians 4:8-9).
3. **Anointing and Light** – Olive oil was used for **anointing** (1 Samuel 16:13) and for keeping the **lamp burning** (Matthew 25:1-13), signifying the **Holy Spirit’s presence** and the need to be spiritually prepared.

##### **Crushing for the Best Oil in Our Lamp**
Jesus Himself was pressed like an olive in **Gethsemane** (which means "oil press"), showing how suffering produces the greatest spiritual fruit. Likewise, our **personal trials and sacrifices** refine us and allow us to shine brightly, just as crushed olives produce the purest oil for a lamp.

This imagery invites us to embrace the refining process, knowing that **our struggles produce the best oil to keep our spiritual lamps burning for God**.

### Saintlyhood & Humility

Tearing down strongholds begins with understanding the foundation of obedience and faithfulness. The saints proclaim, "Joy is worth attaining!" Those walking in boldness, with the strength of the Holy Spirit, understand this deeply.

Some dismiss the personal and sacred act of giving, presenting a false dilemma: salvation by faith is what we believe. Some avoid discussing obedience. The Saints proclaim, "There is Joy in Obedience." Some present a flawed approach which creates a forced duality thus producing a man-made hurdle for the new believer. Jesus came to abolish that. Under this false diachomity, the new beliver is then set upon a tighrope, but Jesus does not see our behavior the way we see our own behavior. Jesus accepts us anyway; His fatherly goodness is rich; He desires to shower His childern with His blessings. Paul himself, who championed salvation by grace alone, also emphasized the importance of generosity and obedience in faith. Additionally, the fallacy of this forced duality leads to unnecessary conflict within the body, when in reality Jesus accepts all walks. Now, granted, Jesus was not a, "you do you boo," type of guy, but he did not come for the self-righteous, but for the lowly in heart, those humble towards God. Giving originates from obedience and faithfulness; Obedience compels our heart towards the shoreline. The saints proclaim, "abundant joy is achievable from obedience and faithfullness to God, and He is generous with those who come to Him without joy, who are low in heart, quietly doing His work.

### The Significance of Seven in the Bible

The number seven holds deep biblical significance—seven days of creation, seven feasts, seven “I Am” statements, and seven miraculous signs in the Gospel of John. Likewise, Paul wrote letters to seven churches: Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Colossae, and Thessalonica. These churches, each with their unique struggles, serve as a lesson to believers today.

Paul’s earliest epistle was to the Galatians. In that region, he and Barnabas planted churches amid fierce opposition. In Lystra, Paul healed a man lame from birth, demonstrating the power of faith. Yet, radical unbelievers stirred up riots, stoning Paul and dragging his body outside the city, assuming he was dead. Miraculously, Paul got up and continued his mission, undeterred by persecution.

The Galatian church was plagued by false teachings claims that obedience to the Law was necessary for salvation. Paul’s letter to them was clear: “We know that a person is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ” (Galatians 2:16). Yet, while salvation is by grace alone, Paul also reminded believers of their call to faithfulness and obedience: “For freedom, Christ set us free. Stand firm, then, and don’t submit again to a yoke of slavery” (Galatians 5:1).

### Obedience, First & Foremost

Giving is an act of obedience. When you give out of obedience you are demonstrating faith in terms how you give, that is, not letting your left hand know what your right hand is doing. In this we find rich rewards. 

False teachers avoid discussing obedience, this leaves new believers stranded, as the importance of obedience is left unrealized, but that's how strong His love is for His children. False teachers preach a new-age "what's in it for me" mindset, which lacks the humility rooted in obedience and faithfulness. Matthew teaches us to not let our left hand know what our right hand is doing. We must even exercise discernment within ourself; We must also walk in continious prayer. Just as Paul encouraged early churches to give, believers today must also recognize the sanctity of their first fruits. Giving is not merely about money; it encompasses time, resources, and service. Paul rebuked the Corinthian troublemakers for their showmanship giving. Likewise, in modern churches, some have turned tithes into a means of profiteering, while others distort giving into the false doctrine of karma. Furthermore, some have turned to giving into using their giving for virtue signaling.

The truth is that joy comes from obedience. It is a challenging path but one with immense rewards. The Holy Spirit leads us in our giving, and we must listen. However, Scripture teaches otherwise: “Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing” (Matthew 6:3). True giving is not performative; Giving in Secret is a sacred covenant between each of us individually, and the creator of the universe.

### Joy

Paul’s journey shows that walking with Jesus brings healing—physically, mentally, and spiritually. As cellular mitosis renews our bodies, so too does faith regenerate our souls. Christ heals and restores us, offering peace of mind and protection. But some flaunt their spiritual immunity, leaving behind those who struggle. Jesus’ message is for all, not some. At the same time, Jesus didn't just say, "You do you boo."

The early church understood this. They faced hardships, yet their faith grew. Today, as a congregation, we must prepare to receive those who are spiritually ill. Many healings will take place, and many will find joy in the light of Christ. As we approach a new season, we must ensure that our lamps remain trimmed and stocked, ready to shine brightly in a world that desperately needs His light. 

### Conclusion

There are some that some who call themselfs intellictuals are teaching that tithing is a myth, and that it is not scriptural. These teachers teach a new-age, feel-good, message, that is not grounded in obedience nor is it grounded in faith. Rather they are arrogant and their teaching is in vain as they challange belivers to only give out of joy, but are blind themselfs to their virtue signaling, because they lack humility in their message. This is the exact humility that is required to produce our best, which often life-long and private between each child of God and Himself. Perhaps there are some who lack the experience necessary to minister to the need and those low in heart, rather they create a roadblock for new belivers, as they install themselfs as clergy and judges, yet they do not judge justly as He commands us.

**Micah 6:8**
He has shown you, O mortal, what is good, and what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God

**“Command the children of Israel that they bring to you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to make the lamps burn continually.”** — Leviticus 24:2  

Oil is essential for a lamp to burn, just as the Holy Spirit and personal sacrifice are essential for a life that shines with the light of Christ (Matthew 5:16). But oil does not come without pressing—something must be crushed. In the same way, for our faith to shine brightly, self-will must be broken.  

Jesus said, **“Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in the light”** (Matthew 10:27), and **“Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house”** (Matthew 5:15). Our confession of faith is meant to be visible, illuminating the world with the truth of Christ. However, if I claim to follow Jesus, my life must align with His example.  

**“For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps: ‘Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth’; who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously.”** — 1 Peter 2:21-23  

If I am to follow in His footsteps, then when I am reviled, I must not revile in return. But this is not easy; it requires something within me to be crushed—my pride, my self-will, my desire for personal honor. **Jesus Himself, though equal with God, humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death** (Philippians 2:5-8). If I am unwilling to let go of my own rights and desires, my lamp will not shine.  

Yet, when self-will is surrendered, when the pressing of trials produces the pure oil of humility and obedience, the light of Christ shines through me. **“But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.”** (2 Corinthians 4:7). Just as crushed olives produce oil for the lamp, a crushed will produces the light of Christ in us.

Do not be like the five foolish virgins who were unprepared. Step into the joy of the Lord, and walk in the strength of His Spirit.

##### Romans 2:28-29

For he is not an outward Jew, one which is one outwardly; Neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh. But he is an inward Jew, one which is one inwardly; Circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter.

##### Deuteronomy 10:16

Circumcise, therefore, the foreskin of your heart, and be not stiffnecked.
