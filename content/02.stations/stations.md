## Praying the Stations of the Cross

    There is no practice more profitable for the entire sanctification of the soul than the frequent meditation of the sufferings of Jesus Christ.
    St. Alphonsus Ligouri

Praying through the stations of the cross gives us the opportunity to take a mini pilgrimage through the last hours of Christ’s life on earth. We contemplate His suffering, His total sacrifice, and what all of that means in our relationship with Him. We are able to take a spiritual walk through teh sacred places which were sanctified by the sufferings and death of our Divine Savior.

## History of this Chaplet

The chaplet was composed by St. Alphonsus Ligouri.

Pope Pius IX and X granted the Chaplet of the Way of the Cross to the Vincentian Order.  Later The Holy Office withdrew it in 1912, since the indulgences can be gained by using the crucifix alone. 
Indulgences

Originally, this pious practice was limited to Jerusalem
and its environs. Gradually it became universal as
several Popes granted plenary and partial indulgences
to the faithful who devoutly meditate on the Way of the
Cross.

    A plenary indulgence every time the devotion is
    completed.
    An additional plenary indulgence if one receives
    Holy Communion on the day.
    Also an additional plenary indulgence if one
    performs the devotion ten times and receives
    Holy Communion within a month after so doing.
    A partial indulgence of ten years for every
    Station made if one was not able to finish the
    Stations.

The conditions for gaining them are:

    Walking from Station to Station when making
    the Way of the Cross privately; when making it
    publicly, it suffices for the priest with the altar
    boys to do so.
    Meditate at each Station on the sufferings of our
    Lord.

These two conditions are essential. No oral prayers are
prescribed; yet they are profitable.

## Praying the Chaplet

This chaplet is typically prayed every Friday during Lent. Your parish likely offers a time for gathering to pray together.

To the sick and to others who cannot go to a church to make the Way of the Cross, the Holy See has given the privilege of gaining the indulgences attached to the Way of the Cross by holding in their hand a specially indulgenced crucifix and saying the prescribed prayers, the Our Father, Hail Mary and Glory be 20 times. 

There are several versions of the stations of the cross. This list follows along with the medals in the stations chaplet and is considered the traditional set of stations. No set is right or wrong, the focus is entering into prayer while remembering Christ’s Passion.

## Let Us Pray.
### Sign of the Cross

In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.

### The Apostle’s Creed – at the crucifix

I believe in God,
the Father Almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and was buried;
He descended into hell;
on the third day He rose again from the dead;
He ascended into heaven,
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty;
from there He will come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the Holy Catholic Church,
the communion of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.

### Act of Contrition – at the first bead

My God, I am sorry for my sins with all of my heart. In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned against You whom I should love above all things. I firmly intend, with the help of your grace, to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin. Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. In his name, my God, have mercy.
Our Father – at the second bead

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
Hail Mary – at the third bead

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Glory Be – at the fourth bead

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, a world without end. Amen.
Prayer to Jesus Christ Crucified – at the fifth bead

My good and dear Jesus, I kneel before you, asking you most earnestly to engrave upon my heart a deep and lively faith, hope and charity, with true repentence for my sins, and a firm resolve to make amends. As I reflect upon your five wounds and dwell upon them with deep compassion and grief, I recall, good Jesus, the words the prophet David spoke long ago of you: “They have pierced my hands and my feet, they have counted all my bones!”

### The First Station: Jesus is Condemned to Death

We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You because by Your holy cross You have redeemed the world.

    Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them: Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know that I find no cause in him. (Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold the Man. When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants, had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause in him. The Jews answered him: We have a law; and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. When Pilate therefore had heard this saying, he feared the more. And he entered into the hall again, and he said to Jesus: Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate therefore saith to him: Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee? Jesus answered: Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin. And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar. Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha. And it was the parasceve of the pasch, about the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king. But they cried out: Away with him; away with him; crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar. Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him forth.
    John 19:4-16 DRA

Through her heart, His sorrow sharing,
All His bitter anguish bearing,
Now at length the sword had passed.

Then, meditating upon these things, pray:

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
HAIL MARY

Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
