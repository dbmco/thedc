# Project Structure

The Digital Catechism is powered by Nuxt. If you are familiar with Nuxt, you will feel right at home.

## Directory Structure

This is the minimal directory structure to run The Digital Catechism website.

```bash
content/
  index.md
app.config.ts
nuxt.config.ts
```

The `content/` directory is where [Markdown pages](/contribute/writing-pages) live.

The `app.config.ts` is where branding and design [are configured](/contribute/configuration).

The Nuxt configuration `nuxt.config.ts` lives [here](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/configuration).
