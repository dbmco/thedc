# We pray to God

#### So that the life of the faithful may be conformed to Christ in the Holy Spirit to the glory of God the Father, we reflect on the great mystery of the faith and we profess and celebrate this mystery by reciting the Apostles Creed and celebrating it in sacramental liturgy.

#### We live from faith in belief of this mystery, and we walk in personal relationship with the one true God thru it.

#### This relationship, is prayer.
